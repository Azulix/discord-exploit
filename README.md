# Discord Nitro Code Generator

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer.

## Installation
1. Open the program directory in your terminal.
2. Run the following command to install the required modules:
```bash
npm install
```
# Usage
After installation, execute the program using the command:
```bash
node index
```
You can specify proxies in the **proxies.txt** text file to avoid rate limits.
The generated codes will be saved in the **promos.txt** text file.
Ensure compliance with Discord's terms of use when using this program. Use proxies to avoid rate limits, and check the **promos.txt** file for the generated codes.

```

If this program gains popularity, I will release a version 2 that can bypass rate limits and another version built with Python.
